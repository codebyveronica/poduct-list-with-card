## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to populate the DOM dynamically with JSON file. I learned how to use and create a JSON file. And how to use your data after populating the DOM. I also learned many other interactions with JavaScript on this project. The increment and decrement functionality was one of these, but I believe the most impactful is the cart functionality. I believe it is very important to know how to create one and know how to deal with quantities. This project served to create a foundation for this for me.

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning about JSON files, populating the DOM dynamically, and about Add to Cart and the Store Cart. Although this project was great to start learning and create a foundation on this, I only managed to do it by researching a lot. I want to keep learning and practicing until I can do it on my own and learn even more complex things to increase these features.
